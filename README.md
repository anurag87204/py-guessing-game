## 🎲 Number Guessing Game

This is a Python script for a simple number guessing game. You guess a number between 1 and 10, and the computer tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## 🌟 What I Learned

- **Loops (`while` loop):** How to keep the game going until the right number is guessed.
- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** How to check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
- **Python's `random` Library:** To make the game interesting by having the computer pick a random number every time.
- **Input and Output:** Getting the player's guess and showing messages.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Run the `guess_the_number.py` script in Python.
2. The game will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 10.
3. Type your guess and press Enter.
4. The game tells you if your guess is right, too high, or too low. Keep guessing until you get it right.
5. When you guess right, you can choose to play again or stop.

## 🔍 Known Issues

- The game does not check if you put in something that's not a number. If you do, it might stop working.
